                    Most machines (like a toaster) are designed to do a few things. Unless you physically alter these machines, they will only be able to do those things. Computers are different. A computer can be programmed to do anything we want, as long as we can write a program that specifies a specific sequence of instructions.

                Just like human languages have grammars, programming languages do too. A grammar is a specification of what is "correct" and what is "incorrect." In languages like English, people can often make sense of sentences that aren't technically "correct," but computers aren't smart enough to do this. This means we have to write code that is exactly "correct" according to the Python interpreter, otherwise our code won't run.

                A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: print 1 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 1 + (without a number at the end) is not. This video does a good job of explaining the Python grammar for "expressions".

                    Variables give programmers a way to give names to values. If my_variable is a variable with a value of 2, then the following code would print out 4:print my_variable + my_variable What does it meant to assign a value to a variable? How is it done?
                    We can assign the value 2 to the variable my_variable by writing code like this:

                    my_variable = 2

                    We can even change the value of a variable by re-assigning it to a different value later.

                    What's the difference between what the equals sign means in 2 + 3 = 5 and my_variable = 5?
                    In the line 2 + 3 = 5, the equals sign means "is the same as".

                    In the line my_variable = 5, the equals sign means "takes the value of".

                    What are some ways variables are useful?
                    Variables can be useful to programmers in many ways:

                    They improve code readability by using names that make sense to humans.
                    They give us a way to store the value of important data.
                    They give us a way to change the value of something (like in the line days = days-1
                    What is the difference between 2 + 2 and "2" + "2"?
                    In Python, 2 is a number while "2" is a string.

                    The code 2 + 2 would give 4.

                    The code "2" + "2" would give "22".

                    A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output. For example, a function named square might take a number as input and produce the square of that number as output.

                    What is the difference between making and using a function?
                    Functions are made by starting a line of code with the keyword def and then giving a function name followed by the function parameters in parentheses. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used (called).

                    In the "body" of the function, we write the code that specifies what to do with the input parameters. For example the following code could be the definition of a function called square:

                    def square(x): 
                    answer = x * x 
                    return answer
                    To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses. Like this:

                    print square(4) 
                    >>>16
                    How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?
                    Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again.

                    What happens if a function doesn't have a return statement?
                    The return keyword tells Python exactly what the function should produce as output. If a function doesn't have a return statement, then you'll get behavior like this:

                    def add_two(x): 
                    answer = x + 2 

                    new_number = add_two(7)
                    print new_number
                    >>>None
                </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            </div>
    </div>
